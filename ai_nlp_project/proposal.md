Project Title: AI-Based Educational Content Generator
Objective: Generate, refine, and evaluate educational content using AI models.
Tools & Libraries:
Model: LLaMA 2 (or GPT-3.5/GPT-4 via Hugging Face)
Libraries: Transformers, PyTorch, spaCy, NLTK
Deployment: FastAPI for API, GitHub Codespaces for development
System Modules:
Prompt-to-Content Generation – Uses a pre-trained transformer model.
Content Refinement – Improves readability, coherence, and inclusivity.
Bias Mitigation – Implements NLP techniques to detect and reduce biases.
Pipeline Design – Modular and scalable architecture.
Evaluation Metrics: Coherence, readability, inclusivity.
Deployment Strategy: Local API via FastAPI or cloud deployment (optional).
